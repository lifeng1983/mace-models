Introduction
---
ONNX is a new open ecosystem for interchangeable AI models.[[link]](https://github.com/onnx/onnx)

The original pretrained model is [here](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/models/image_classification)

Before deploying these onnx models, we used onnx_optimizer.py in mace/tools/ to generate optimized models.
